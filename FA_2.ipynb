    "One of the largest South-East Asian ethnic groups to live in Canada are Punjabis, hailing from the Northwestern parts of India and Eastern Pakistan. Punjabis first arrived in Canada during the late 19th century to work in the forestry industry. Primarily concentrated in the western province of British Columbia, the Punjabi population initially peaked in 1908 before an ensuing period of population decline and stagnation followed. In the mid-20th-century Canadian immigration laws were relaxed, fostering rapid population growth into the present day. Today, the largest Punjabi communities in Canada are situated in the province of British Columbia, concentrated in Vancouver, and the province of Ontario, particularly in Toronto. The dominant religion of Punjabis, Sikhism is the 7th largest in Canada, accounting for about 1.4% of the total population, roughly 500,000 people as of 2011. But numbers and statistics aside, it is the cultural influence of the Punjabis that has contributed much to the social entropy of the country. Although the largest settlement of Punjabis still remains in British Columbia, By the 1980s, the traditional Punjabi immigration patterns began to shift. Ontario soon became an important center of immigration to Canada. Large Punjabi populations began to appear across the Greater Toronto Area. Later in the 1990s, Alberta became another important immigration destination for Punjabis. Most concentrated in Edmonton and Calgary.\n",
    "Today, the Punjabi population of Canada is 668,240 with the largest community still located in British Columbia. In addition, Punjabi is the third most spoken language of the Parliament of Canada. So it is quite imperative that there is a burgeoning demand for South-East Asian cuisines across the different neighborhoods of Toronto, and it is this prospect that draws many Punjabi youths from both India and Pakistan to immigrate to Canada, which is also reflected by the data pertaining to worldwide immigration to Canada over the last few decades. So for an aspiring Punjabi youth, qualified in culinary arts or hotel management to open a restaurant in Canada, Toronto is likely to come up as one of the foremost choices. This is where our program comes in, where we can analyze them and visualize the distribution of such region-specific restaurants across different neighborhoods in Toronto so that the person can have a tentative idea of the possible demand that will help him to better decide the final location of his enterprise.\n",

    "The data to be used were obtained from Wikipedia, converted to an excel file named List 1.csv which contains a list of different neighborhoods in Toronto pertaining to the listed postal codes and their corresponding boroughs. The geospatial data containing the latitudes and longitudes for the corresponding postal codes have been obtained from an excel file called Geospatial_Coordinates. The combined dataset with both the geospatial and neighborhood datasets was combined using pandas, and the specific neighborhoods of interest were obtained from Foursquare location data using the Foursquare API, to obtain the data regarding various places of interests like restaurants, coffee shops, parks, toy stores, etc. given a certain radius of interest. The areas of interest to be investigated as prospective locations for the restaurant were obtained from the Wikipedia page dedicated to Punjabi Canadians.\n",

    "To begin with, this section encompasses a larger area than that covered in the previous section. Hence we are going to analyse the results clusterwise, starting with cluster 7, covering the neighborhoods of High Park and The Junction South. Among the top 5 venues, there are virtually no restaurants that are anything like the taste palette of Punjabi food, the closest being Mexican food whic as we all know tend to be very spicy.Same goes for cluster 6 and cluster 2 and 3. Going on to cluster 5, the Davisville neighbourhood will probably not be a good choice given the 2nd most common venue. Same goes for the 4th most common venue of Runnymeade and Swansea neighborhoods where the vegan restaurant is likely to be preferred by the Sikh community who make up the largest section of the Punjabi diaspora. In the 4th cluster all the neighborhoods but St. James Town and Cabbagetown may be considered as suitable restaurant spots. Cluster 1 is also comprised of mostly suitable neighborhoods barring Commerce Court, Victoria Hotel, Church and Wellesly. As for Cluster 0, given the large number of spots that it encompasses, we had to resort to a code in order to have a list of suitable spots for a Punjabi restaurant, that is as follows: "
